# My NeoVim Config

## Installation

Required neovim version `NVIM v0.5+`, if your distro's package repository doesn't provide then have a look at this [reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/f9661m/comment/fipokxi/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

After Installation check the version by running `nvim --version`

Install a nerd font, [check this](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads). Install any of them.

Open neovim, you should get some errors, just press enter key and run `:PackerInstall` followed by `:PackerSync`. This will install all the plugins.

Install the Required LSP servers
